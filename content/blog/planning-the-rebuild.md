Before jumping into code and content migration, I took some time to clarify the goals and architecture of the Novalux rebuild — the foundation that will guide every decision moving forward.

### Defining the Vision

The core purpose of the new <em>xavierroy.in</em> is to serve as a **modular digital home** — a place that tells my story, showcases my work, and connects all facets of my professional and creative life.

To achieve this, I want the site to be:

- **Flexible**: Easily updated with new projects, writings, and social integrations  
- **Coherent**: A unified design language and content strategy that flows naturally  
- **Maintainable**: Minimal technical debt, clear structure, and automation where possible

### Content Structure

When I audited my scattered online presence — old blog posts, GitHub projects, newsletter archives, and social media , I was surprised by how much valuable content was buried across different platforms. This reinforced my need for a centralized hub.

I've organized everything into four primary content pillars:

- **Projects & Experiments**: Highlighting key works and ongoing explorations  
- **Writing & Publications**: Blogs, newsletters, and essays spanning multiple platforms  
- **Reading & Learning**: Book lists, reviews, and notes documenting continuous growth  
- **Social & Community**: Federated feeds and links to various social profiles  

This modular approach will allow me to scale the site organically over time.

### Next Steps

With vision and structure in place, the immediate goal is to:

- Set up the project repository and basic Eleventy config  
- Establish content folders and sample markdown posts  
- Build the initial layout and homepage structure  

In the next post, I’ll dive into the actual setup and the choices I make along the way.
